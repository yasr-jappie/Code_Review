# Code_Review

Section A 
- A students code was given based on a set of instructions. I needed to give detailed feedback on the submission and help fix their coding problems based on their code.

Section B
- One of the tasks that I felt very proud creating was the inventory task for a shoe business. We were given an inventory text file with the shoes information and we needed
to manipulate the data based on our programmes functions.
- Two inventory files is needed, inventory.py and inventory.txt. Both files can be found the repository above.

Section C
- A java file that converts a number given by the user into words.
