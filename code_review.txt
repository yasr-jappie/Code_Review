positive aspects -You have the overall idea correctly, however you are making a few
errors that is giving you syntax and runtime errors.

improvements - Firstly you should always try to follow the PEP 8 style convention 
when using python, I will source a link below that will help you with that.

In the line 2 you are defing your class with 2 arguments but it only needs to take
in a string and thus resulting in an error. When you use the sorted method you are 
not parsing anything into it and causes a syntax error.

Finally when printing out the string list you need to pass in the string variable
and not the entire string list.
